# Ruby Project: Custom Enumerables

## Introduction

You should be very familiar with the Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there’s no magic to it, you’re going to rebuild those methods.

## Assignment Goals

This project is a great opportunity to get comfortable using **yield** and the **#call** methods.
For this assignment, you will add your new methods onto the existing Enumerable module.
